This project implements example applications for Flash-based audio and video communication using the [Flash-VideoIO](http://myprojectguide.org/p/flash-videoio/index.html) component. <em>The software is licensed as LGPL, so if you make a modification to the source you should contribute back the modifications</em>. The Flash-VideoIO component is a reusable generic Flash application to record and play live audio and video content. It can be used for a variety of use cases in audio and video communication, e.g., live camera view, recording of multimedia messages, playing video files from web server or via streaming, live video call and conferencing using client-server as well as peer-to-peer technology. This project web site provides several examples applications and tutorial with (open) source code on how to do these scenarios.

# Announcements #
**New**: The VideoIO sources are now checked in and available as LGPL. It is our humble request to please please contribute back any improvements or modifications. If you have major improvements, we will be happy to add you as a committer/contributor. Thank you!

The test page allows you to see the behavior of various properties as you set some properties. Before you use this project, **please check** the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/flash-videoio/wiki/Faq) page for common gotchas!

## Download ##

You can download the example applications source code in this project under the source tab. You can get the latest version of VideoIO.swf from the [download](http://code.google.com/p/flash-videoio/downloads/list) page.

## Support ##

If you are a developer who wants to add a new feature to VideoIO or use the software in your project, feel free to post a message to the support group to let us know. The goal is to make VideoIO independent of the example applications, so that developers do not need to understand or know Flash programming.

You can post a message to the [support group](http://groups.google.com/group/myprojectguide). You don't need to subscribe to that group to post a message. **I look forward to hearing from you!**

# Example Projects #

These examples are available in SVN under `examples` directory. These applications are tested only on Firefox browser, and are also reported to work on Chrome and Safari. These applications: IIT Web Conference, Intencity AIRphone, and Public Chat are portable across different browsers and systems. Other applications **do not work on Internet Explorer (IE) browser** because I used some Javascript that is unsupported in IE.

  * [IIT Web Conference](http://gardo1.rice.iit.edu/webconf/): <a href='http://gardo1.rice.iit.edu/webconf/'><img src='http://myprojectguide.org/p/flash-videoio/webconf-logo.jpg' align='right' border='0' /></a>This web-based application allows you to do multiparty conference and slides presentation using Flash based real-time audio and video.
